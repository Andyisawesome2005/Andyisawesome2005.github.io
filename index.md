### CPSC 120

* [Lab 1](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-01-alan_hernandez.git)

    Lab 1 is one of the favorites of mine as it first introduced me to the world of coding. Our first lab was the infamous Hello World code that I had some issues with but I was able to complete successfully. I have always wanted to learn to code, so making my first-ever project excited me as I can finally consider myself a coder after wanting to learn how to code for so long. 

* [Lab 6]()

    Lab 6, part 2 was another favorite of mine as me and my partner learned how to code a blackjack game. I love blackjack, so learning to code the game and how complex an Ace is to represent a 1 but also an 11 was challenging. This challenge ultimately made me a better coder and where I want to be in terms of knowledge and progress.

* [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-08-alan-and-jessica)

    Finally, Lab 8, part 2 challenged me and my partner and became my favorite lab. Part 2 was the most challenging, and it made my partner and I struggle, but once we finally got our code correct, we were excited that we had succeeded. The sheer excitement left reminded us that while coding may be complex, we can still figure it out with enough effort.
